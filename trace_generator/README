This tool generates a list of packet headers to probe the input filter set.
Entries in the output header trace have the following format (packet header fields are unsigned integers):

<Source Address>	<Destination Address>	<Source Port>	<Destination Port>	<Protocol>	<Filter Number>

The Filter Number simply records the filter used to generate the header.
This may NOT be the best-matching (or first-matching) filter for the packet header.
The user must independently verify the correctness of their search engine.
The tool provides control over the size of the trace and the locality of reference of the trace.

COMPILE:
make all

USAGE:
./trace_generator <Pareto parameter a> <Pareto parameter b> <scale> <filter set filename>

Pareto parameters are used to control locality of reference.
Pareto cummulative density function: D(x) = 1 - (b/x)^a
	Examples:
	No locality of reference, a = 1, b = 0
	Low locality of reference, a = 1, b = 0.0001
	High locality of reference, a = 1, b = 1
Scale parameter limits the size of the trace
	Threshold = (# of filters in filter set) * scale
	Once the size of the trace exceeds the threshold, the generator terminates
	Note that a large burst near the end of the process may cause the trace to be considerably larger than the Threshold

EXAMPLE:
./trace_generator 1 0.1 10 MyFilters

OUTPUT:
<filter set filename>_trace
This file will contain a list of header entries in the previous defined format.
